Firstie's SeeFar Builds

These files only replace the SeeFar part of the SeeFar mod pack.
For the other parts (Camera, Font, Resolution, TimeOfDay), as well as a more detailed readme, please refer to the main SeeFar 2020 release.

These files are rebuilds & improvements of the SeeFar files.

Originals from SeeFar 2020:
- Supported moods of the Kingdom of Ehb, Utraean Peninsula, and Legends of Aranna
- Three different view distances to choose from: 20, 50, 100
- Three different camera distances to choose from: normal, Plus6, Plus12

Firstie's SeeFar Builds version 1.0:
- Added support for moods of Yesterhaven & Return to Arhok
- Included teleport fix (keeping original distances for the black teleport moods)
Version 1.1:
- Values changed very slightly for consistency: the number e.g. 50 means +50% fog far-distance, etc.
- Added a SeeFar0 build just for testing purposes
- Added a SeeFar200 build for visual purposes only (not gameplay), and a "Foggy" variant where the fog near-distance isn't changed (barely visible tho)
